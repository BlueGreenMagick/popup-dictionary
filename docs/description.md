**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki 2.0 (≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta releases are currently **unsupported**.

OR

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0 and Anki 2.1. However, as the Anki 2.1 release line is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/popup-dictionary/issues).
